------how to set up the 2012 player on your computer------
make sure you have something cool like xampp or something
and just copy all the files into your htdocs folder or where you put your website files, these work in a directory as well EXCEPT the get_video_info which HAS to be placed in the root and so does the html5_player_template
continuing on, you'll see a nice video in the video folder. it's wide.mp4, it's there to tell you if you did it right.
once you've copied all your files, visit "localhost/player?v=wide.mp4" or if you put it in a directory, "localhost/directory/player?v=wide.mp4"

note: you can also use embed.php to test this rather than player, the player enables most of the site-player functionality when the embed is the embed functionality

if you set it up right, you should have a play button staring back at you, just click it and if the video loads, you're smart.
ok, now you're wondering, how do you change "Insert video name here" or "Insert author name here"?
you'll have to edit two or three files to your liking, get_video_info.php and player.php or embed.php
open them up with your preferred text editor, i use notepad++. 
you'll see i left you with some variables to set, $name and $author, just set them to your liking.

now how do you add your own video?
make sure it's a <video> tag supported format (mp4? webm? ogv?)
drop it into the video folder. if you copied rabbit.webm into the folder,
access it like so: "blablabla/player?v=rabbit.webm"

if it worked, give yourself a high-five.
